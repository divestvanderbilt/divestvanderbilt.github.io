  content : "<b> Our Mission:</b> The mission of Dores Divest is to achieve fossil fuel divestment at Vanderbilt University, through both disruptive and non-disruptive means, as a step towards climate justice. <br><br> Climate change is an existential threat to society and demands immediate and transformative actions by individuals, governments, and institutions such as Vanderbilt University. We propose that Vanderbilt:

<br>
<br>
<b>
1.	Immediately freeze any new investment in fossil fuel companies, and
<br>
<br>
2.	Divest from current holdings in these companies within 3 years, and
<br>
<br>
3.	Reinvest these holdings into carbon-free energy investments. </b>
<br>
<br>
We hope you will join us in accelerating Vanderbilt's effort to stand on the right side of this historic environmental, socioeconomic, and racial justice. 

The time to divest is now!"
