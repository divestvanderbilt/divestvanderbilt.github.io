### Our Team!

The communities most affected by changing climatic conditions are the least likely to be invited to participate in discussions. That is why Dores Divest has made the following commitments to ensure our effort is more inclusive:

1. We will partner with the Multicultural Leadership Council (MLC) when engaging on issues of climate justice
	* We have established a working relationship with the MLC President to find the best ways to partner with multi-cultural orgs, whether thatâ€™s supporting MLC orgs in their events or finding speakers and perspectives to amplify at our events
2. We will trust POC to speak for their own experiences regarding climate change
	* The intersectional elements of climate change often include challenging topics, such as immigration or AGL. We invite our speakers to speak freely on these topics.
3. We reject activism that is performative without taking real action
	* We are proud to have advocated for divestment during meaningful conversations with faculty and admin
	* We are also proud to have used our platform to host a relief supply event for Waverly TN climate flood victims
	* We will be mindful of how to better translate our platform into tangible actions, such as by sending additional volunteers to directly support Waverly recovery efforts (sign up here) and by promoting relevant literature and other community actions
4. We will never make light of the painful realities of climate change
	* While the admin's backwards logic for avoiding climate action is worth calling out, the painful experience of climate change, often felt by POC, is not a laughing matter. We will be objective in our coverage of climate impacts
5. We reject exclusivity in activism
	* We have never and will never turn away a student for wanting to get more involved. Our organizing exec board is open to all and made up of equally important positions. Complete this form here if you'd like to get more involved.
6. When we come short of these goals, we will take accountability
	* We will identify why our actions were insensitive, apologize to the individuals hurt by our actions, and outline a better path forward. Anything less is unacceptable.
	* We will continue to be open to your feedback
7. Your feedback is valuable and we are always willing to listen to new and/or different perspectives if it helps us become a better campaign
	* Email doresdivest@gmail.com or DM our instagram for a faster response
