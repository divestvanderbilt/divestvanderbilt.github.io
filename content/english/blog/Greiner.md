Patrick Greiner’s research program explores how various forms of inequality emerging from social, political, and economic structures pattern socio-environmental outcomes in ways that are often detrimental to environmental systems and harmful to marginalized social groups. Put differently, Greiner’s research speaks to the ways in which inequality facilitates, and even necessitates, environmental degradations at the international and national level in the contemporary socio-economic system.  In order to get at this broader question, Greiner’s research examines how societies attempt to mitigate environmental concerns; how inequality constrains or facilitates social groups’ ability to address such concerns; and how various measures of inequality shape our understandings of the source and extent of environmental problems.
