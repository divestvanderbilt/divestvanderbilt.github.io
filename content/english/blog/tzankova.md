Zdravka Tzankova is an Associate Professor of Sociology at Vanderbilt University. Tzankova is an interdisciplinary researcher with experience in environmental policy and corporate sustainability. Her current work focuses on sustainable food procurement and carbon reduction initiatives by business actors. Tzankova studies such initiatives as a form of private, market-driven environmental regulation. She is interested in their impact and implications, especially their potential to accelerate sustainability transitions through positive synergy with public environmental policy.  
 
Tzankova’s current work emphasizes the following issue areas:  
	· Governance strategies for accelerating renewable transitions in the US and beyond 
	· New governance frameworks for addressing agricultural nutrient pollution in the US 
	· Ways of reducing sustainability-equity tradeoffs in private environmental and agri-food governance (US and transnational)  
 
IN TERMS OF ONE-LINERS TO HIGHLIGHT – HERE ARE SOME OPTIONS:   

> I work to identify disruptive new governance approaches to solution-resistant problems like climate change and agricultural nutrient pollution 
> I work to advance sustainability transitions by identifying opportunities for positive synergy between public environmental governance and market-driven environmental regulation  
> My work looks for ways of reducing sustainability-equity tradeoffs in environmental governance
