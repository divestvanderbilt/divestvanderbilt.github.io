Vanderbilt's most famous former student, Al Gore, [called for fossil fuel divestment](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/5/30/al-gore-class-day-2019/) at Harvard University, which ultimately divested in [2021](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2021/09/10/harvard-divest-fossil-fuels/).
We need the leadership of more alums like Al and yourself to help turn the tide on fossil fuels at Vandy!

# Are you a Vandy alum?
## Here are 3 ways for you to get involved.

1. Don't donate 'til divestment! 
	* When the alumni office sends a student to ask you for your donation on giving day, politely decline
	* Let the representative know <b>"I won't be donating until Vanderbilt divests from fossil fuels."</b> Money talks!
	* Check out coverage of our boycott of donations last year [(link here)](https://vanderbilthustler.com/39793/featured/vanderbilt-naacp-divestvu-and-dores-divest-jointly-call-for-giving-day-boycott/), senior turn out decreased by about 50%!
2. [Sign the community petition](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSctiWHuZPyfC6HuqV8R_3ML9dCZQGxNf7Sjj7ZSRgEl7vwGzw/viewform)
	* Hundreds of other alumni have already signed, but we need your name and email as well. You can also opt-in to hear about future events! [Sign here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSctiWHuZPyfC6HuqV8R_3ML9dCZQGxNf7Sjj7ZSRgEl7vwGzw/viewform)
3. Discuss Divestment at Alumni Events
	* Share our petition at local chapter meetings and talk about why you're worried about climate. The more spaces we create to discuss fossil fuel impacts the better!
	* Email us at doresdivest (at) gmail.com if you'd like to collaborate at one of our events or an alumni chapter meeting!
