Betsey Robinson (Harvard University, A.B., A.L.M.; University of Pennsylvania, Ph.D.) teaches courses in the archaeology, architecture, and art of the ancient Mediterranean world. Focusing on human landscapes and attitudes toward nature,  architecture, infrastructure, and the rise and fall of cities, her research engages regularly with environmental and climate studies. Since 1997 she has conducted research at the Corinth Excavations of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, working especially on water supply and use. Her book, Histories of Peirene: A Corinthian Fountain in Three Millennia (Princeton: ASCSA 2011), won the 2011 PROSE Prize for Archaeology and Anthropology. At Corinth she is currently leading an interdisciplinary study of the "Peirene Valley," through the ages, from its aboriginal state through the installation of infrastructure and industry as well as religious architecture in the 1st millennium BCE, then to the urbanization and later the decline of the area in the 1st millennium CE. Her current book project explores resources, religion, and culture in mountainous areas of central Greece.
