Hi.  My name is Ole Molvig.  I am a professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville TN, USA.  I explore how science, technology, and society interact in the past, present, and future.

I aim to integrate the humanities into emergent technologies like artificial intelligence or virtual reality, as well as applying those technologies back to the humanities.

I also work in the history and communications of science and technology.  I want to understand how really difficult ideas, like Einsteinâ€™s General Theory of Relativity or Artificial Intelligence, are explained to - and understood by - others.  I investigate how we can apply these answers from the past to better inform our future.

Before Vanderbilt, I taught History at Yale and received my Ph.D. from Princeton in the History of Science.
