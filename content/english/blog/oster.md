Dr. Jessica Oster is an Associate Professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences. 
Her research interests lie in documenting past variations in terrestrial rainfall and understanding the drivers of these variations. Her approach is interdisciplinary, coupling diverse and quantitative geochemical tools with sophisticated global circulation models. She develops and interprets records of climate change from cave minerals such as stalagmites, that are particularly sensitive to changes in rainfall amount, source, and seasonality. She is also interested in understanding how modern cave systems respond to seasonal and interannual environmental changes with an eye toward using this understanding to provide an interpretative framework for calibrating paleoclimate records from stalagmites. Presently, she has active research projects in California, Tennessee, Wyoming, and India. Dr. Oster teaches courses on Environmental Geochemistry, Paleoclimatology, Isotope Geochemistry, and Careers Pathways in Earth and Environmental Science. She is the Vanderbilt coordinator of the Earth Horizons Program that works to promote diversity within the geosciences.
