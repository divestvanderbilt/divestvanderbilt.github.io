Steven L. Goodbred is Professor and Chair of the Earth and Environmental Sciences Department at Vanderbilt University. Goodbred studies the relationship between humans and depositional landscapes—places like river deltas, where floods are frequent. His current research on the Bengal basin and Ganges-Brahmaputra River delta in Bangladesh investigates how various forcing mechanisms – climate, tectonics, humans, and tidal, fluvial, and marine processes – interact along the continental margin to define the behavior of river deltas and coastal environments. These settings are home to over 150 million people in the Bengal region, putting humans, infrastructure, and economies at risk while placing huge demand on local land, energy, and water resources. Throughout history this coastal population has endured recurring stressors caused by storms, flooding, and land loss – less obvious are the longer-term impacts of climate change, sea-level rise, and a growing population. Interwoven with this continental-margin fabric are many fundamental research questions concerning past environmental change, the recurrence and impact of coastal hazards, and the effect of humans on the landscape. Supporting our current efforts on these topics are National Science Foundation grant  Coastal SEES: Multi-scale modeling and observations of landscape dynamics, mass balance, and network connectivity for a sustainable Ganges-Brahmaputra delta , which is a larger interdisciplinary project with VU colleagues John Ayers, Jonathan Gilligan, and Hiba Baroud, as well as partners Irina Overeem (CU-Boulder), Carol Wilson (LSU), and Paola Passalacqua (UT-Austin).
